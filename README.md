# OSMBonusPack
osmdroid is a library to interact with OpenStreetMap data inside an Android application. It offers an almost full/free replacement to Android map objects: MapView, MapController, Overlays, etc.

This "OSMBonusPack" library complements osmdroid with (very) useful classes:

*  [Markers](Tutorial_0) with nice and flexible "cartoon-bubbles",
*  [Routes and Directions](Tutorial_1),
*  [Points of Interests](Tutorial_2) (directory services),
*  [Marker Clustering](Tutorial_3),
*  Polyline, [Polygon](Tutorial_5) and [GroundOverlay](Tutorial_5), similar to their Google Maps equivalents,
*  Support for [KML and GeoJSON](Tutorial_4) content,
*  Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding,
*  Integrated Cache Management tools for off-line maps
*  and more...

Have a look to the [Features](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/features).

The [[OSMNavigator]] application demonstrates the use of these classes. This is a generic-purpose Map/Navigation tool, including a KML viewer and editor.

# Examples
