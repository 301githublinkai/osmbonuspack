# OSMBonusPack
osmdroid is a library to interact with OpenStreetMap? data inside an Android application. It offers an almost full/free replacement to Android map objects: MapView?, MapController?, Overlays, etc.

This "OSMBonusPack" library complements osmdroid with (very) useful classes:

*  Markers with nice and flexible "cartoon-bubbles",
*  Routes and Directions,
*  Points of Interests (directory services),
*  Marker Clustering,
*  Polyline, Polygon and GroundOverlay, similar to their Google Maps equivalents,
*  Support for KML and GeoJSON content,
*  Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding,
*  Integrated Cache Management tools for off-line maps
*  and more...
Have a look to the Features.

The OSMNavigator application demonstrates the use of these classes. This is a generic-purpose Map/Navigation tool, including a KML viewer and editor.
